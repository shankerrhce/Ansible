i) Approved by the Government
ii) To be applicable or in force over a certain territory
iii) To be obeyed by all people in that territory
Cyber Law is also known as Internet Law or Information Technology
Law
Cyber Law is the Law governing cyberspace or the Internet.
The Law which governs the legal aspects of a ‘paperless’ world
Is there a need for Cyber Law?
We are in a hyper connected world
Dependence on cyber space has percolated to almost all
aspects of day to day life
In cyberspace, every action and reaction has some techno-
legal aspect related to it.
The uniqueness of cyber space, reveals aspects which
conventional law is inadequate to deal with.
For the first time In the history of mankind, arose a need for a
law to regulate a ‘paper less’ intangible world
Challenges unique to Cyberspace
It has an intangible dimension
Is global in nature
Provides ease of connectivity and is economically efficient
Has utter disrespect for territorial jurisdiction/physical
boundaries
Handles humungous volumes of ‘data’ traffic every second
Has enormous potential for ‘Anonymity’
Facilitates extreme mobility of information
Is volatile in nature
What does Cyber Law Encompass?
Electronic & Digital Signatures
Intellectual Property
Cyber Crimes
Data Protection & Privacy
Introduction to Information
Technology Act, 2000

Overview
Should we care to know
about cyber crimes & the
Law?

Ability of launching attacks
outside their physical
jurisdiction
As students of MCA
program do you require to
know the law?
Information/data theft is the most
expensive and fast scaling cyber crime
Ransomware infection rates saw a huge increase in 2021 ,
largely due to the increased importance of online learning
and teleworking platforms
The average cost of downtime is 24 times higher than the
average ransom amount.
Motivations are also changing, moving from making money
through nefarious tactics to collecting data that can be used to
cash out on multiple subsequent attacks
As students of MCA program do you
require to know the law?
These core questions cannot be ignored-
If there exists a vulnerability,it is sure to be exploited
Everything is vulnerable in some way
In the light of the above, the truth that there warrants a necessity to
fully understand what is legally required when it comes to securing
the personal data of employees,customers and third parties.
Like all legal matters, your company’s legal obligations in a way
depend on you as the professional and hence it becomes rather
vital that you understand the scope of your legal obligations.
Should we care to know about cyber
crimes & the Law?
Hyper connected world
Data is new gold
Information/data theft is the most expensive and fast scaling
cyber crime
Sophistication of cyber criminals increasing
Ability of launching attacks outside their physical jurisdiction
Hyper connected world
Connectivity is part of everyday life
Demarcation of private and public space is almost obliterated.
World has become more dynamic, uncertain and increasingly
complex.
Potential Anonymity
The insecurity of the internet
Data is the new ‘Gold’- Data is the new
‘Oil’
Dependency on internet creates new challenges and threats
In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, which involves;
Innovation, technology and Artificial intelligence a new oil has
emerged.
Similar to oil, which gains extra worth when transformed into
more constructive products; when data is processed, analyzed
and utilized efficiently and instantly, it gains considerable
value.
With such rising data, there comes a risk of loosing it, data
falling in wrong hands etc and hence there arises a need to
protect it.
Information/data theft is the most
expensive and fast scaling cyber crime
Ransomware infection rates saw a huge increase in 2021 ,

Cyber Crimes & the Law-
Session-2.1- Various
Prominent Cybercrimes
D. Prem Kamath
Advocate
High Court of Kerala
Overview
Some major cyber crimes
that could culminate in data
theft-

Phishing
Spear phishing
Ransomware attack
DoS
DDoS
Phishing
A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank
account numbers, or access to a larger computerized system through a
fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site. The perpetrator
typically masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person.

Spear Phishing
A highly targeted phishing attack, usually to a specific
individual or department within an organization.
Ransomware Attack
A type of malware that attempts to deny access to a user’s
data, usually by encrypting the data with a key known only to
the hacker who deployed the malware, until a ransom is paid.
DoS Attack
Is when legitimate users are unable to access information
systems, devices, or other network resources due to the
actions of a malicious cyber threat actor.
DDoS
Is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a
targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the
target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet
traffic by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as
sources of attack traffic.
Brief timeline
1940 s- when the giant machines were limited to small number of
people and they will not networked-the threat was almost non-
existent

1950 s-is when the phone phreaking emerged when perpetrators
used to hijack the protocols of telecom companies remotely to
make free calls

Brief timeline
1960 s-has the first-ever reference to malicious hacking in the
Massachusetts Institution of Technology’s student newspaper-
although the attacks had no commercial or geopolitical benefits.

1970 s-cyber security began in 1972 under the advanced research
projects agency network (ARPANET)

Brief timeline
1980 s-the transition from ARPANETto the Internet, which brought an
increase in high-profile attacks and in 1983 the terms “Trojan horse”
and “computer virus” were first coined.

1990 s-became the happening decade-the first polymorphic viruses
were created in 1990 - many viruses, malware and stealth capability
developed in the 90 s

Brief timeline
2000 s-is when threats diversified and multiplied-worms designed to
propagate via IRC arrived, zero-day attacks arrived

2010 s-many high-profile breaches and attacks impacting national
security of countries and costing businesses millions

With the pandemic the world has seen a spike in cyber attacks
especially ransomware attacks

Cyber Crimes & the Law-
Session- 3 - Other Relevant
Offences

Other Relevant Offences
Tampering with computer source
document
Identity theft
Cheating by Personation
Violation of privacy
Preservation and retention of
information by intermediaries
Protected system
Abetment of offences
Important case law relating to
each offence
S.65 – Tampering with
Computer Source Documents
Whoever knowingly or intentionally conceals or destroys or alters
Or intentionally or knowingly causes another to conceal, destroy or
alter
Any computer source code used for a computer program,
computer system or computer network
When the computer source code is required to be kept or
maintained by law
Liable with imprisonment up to 3 years and/or fine of Rs. Two
Lakhs
Explanation for ‘Source Code’

For the purpose of S. 65 , computer source code
means the listing of programs, computer
commands, design and layout and program
analysis of computer resource in any form
Case Law – Syed Asifuddin Vs. State of
Andhra Pradesh & Anr.
The subscriber purchased a Reliance handset and Reliance mobile
services together under the Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer Scheme.
The subscriber was attracted by better tariff plans of other service
providers and hence,wanted to shift to other service providers.
The petitioners (staff members of TATA Indicom) hacked the
Electronic Serial Number (hereinafter referred to as “ESN”).
The Mobile Identification Number (MIN) of Reliance handsets were
irreversibly integrated with ESN, the reprogramming of ESN made
the device would be validated by Petitioner’s service provider and
not by Reliance Infocomm.
Whether manipulation of ESN programmed
into a mobile handset amounts to an
alteration of source code under Section 65 of
the IT Act?
Every cell phone operator is required to obtain SID from the
licensor i.e., Government of India. Further, ESN is a permanent part
of the phone whereas MIN and SID are programmed into phone
when one purchases a service plan and have the phone activity.
When a customer of second respondent opts for its services, the
MIN and SID are programmed into the handset. If some one
manipulates and alters ESN, as per the case of second respondent,
Samsung/LG handsets which are exclusively used by them become
usable by other service providers likeTATA Indicom.
Therefore, prima facie, when the ESN is altered, the offence under
Section 65 of I.T. Act is attracted because every service provider like
second respondent has to maintain its own SID code and also
gives a customer specific number to each instrument used to avail
the services provided.

S.66D – Cheating by Personation
Whoever by means of a computer device or computer resource cheats
by personating,
shall be punished by
Imprisonment of either description for a term that may extend to three
years or fine which may extend to one lakh or both.
S.66D – Cheating by Personation
If a person *cheats by pretending to be some other person or by
knowingly substituting one person for another, or representing that he
or any other person is a person other than he or such person really is.

*cheating is the fraudulent obtaining of another’s property by means of
a false symbol or token or by other illegal practices.

Case Study –
“A” creates a fake profile on ‘X’ social media platform using the
photograph of “B”
Thereafter “A” reaches out on X social media platform to “C”
who is a friend of ”B”, purporting him to be “B” and states that
he is stuck in a foreign land after his wallet, passport and
luggage has been stolen and therefore urgently requires
Rs. X/-
Believing the storyline, “C” transfers the amount of money
sought to the bank account shared by “A”.
Here “A” has committed an offence that could attract S. 66 D of
the IT Act

Access Card issued to a person
Case Study
‘A’ creates a profile in Twitter using the photograph of ‘B’.
‘B’ finds the fake profile and lodges a police complaint.
Creating a fake profile using the photograph of another
person, would attract Section 66 C of the IT Act, which is
punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to three years and fine which may extend to
rupees one lakh.

Cyber Crimes & the Law-
General Data Privacy
Regulation- General
Introduction
D. Prem Kamath
Advocate
High Court of Kerala
Overview
Need for data protection
laws
What is GDPR?
Why learn?
Why do we need data protection
laws?
In a digital world, data privacy is critical.
As the world continues to switch to a largely online lifestyle, the
volume of data processed is also increasing exponentially.
Also, the skills and the opportunities for retrieving different types
of personal data are evolving extremely fast.
Unauthorised, careless or ignorant processing of personal data can
cause great harm to persons and companies.
And more importantly, ways of collecting personal data have
become increasingly elaborated and less easily detectable.
Data protection regulations safeguard personal information from
being exploited for fraudulent purposes.
What is GDPR?
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) mandates a
baseline set of standards for companies that handle EU
citizens’ data to better safeguard the processing and
movement of citizens’ personal data.
GDPR was approved by European Parliament in 2016 and
went into effect on May 25, 2018.
GDPR replaces EU Data Protection Directive of 1995.
GDPR requirements apply to each member state of the
European Union, aiming to create more consistent protection
of consumer and personal data across EU nations.
WHY LEARN?
It has been considered a major milestone in addressing individuals’
rights relating to data privacy.
The GDPR applies to personal data in any form. For example, not just
digital records, but also paper-based records.
The rights that the GDPR gives to individuals in the EU include:
clear and transparent information on how their data is processed
access to view their data
transfer of their data from one data-processing organisation to another
deletion of their data
explicit indication of consent required to process their data information
when their data is lost or stolen
adaptation of information to suit children’s needs.
Contd...
There are five important rights indicated in the GDPR:
the right to basic information ,
right to access ,
right to erasure or deletion ,
right to restrict processing , and
right to rectify or correct data.
These are areas could potentially overlap with your work as a
professional and an understanding of the regulations could
add value to your professional profile as well as competence
at work.

processing of personal data
1. Personal data shall be:
a. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to
the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’);

b. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not
further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those
purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public
interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical
purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered

That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules
of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of
processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the
processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage
periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including
measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific

the personal data have been collected is not based on the data
subject’s consent or on a Union or Member State law which
constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a
democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to
in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain
whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the
purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take
into account, inter alia:
a. any link between the purposes for which the personal data have
been collected and the purposes of the intended further
processing;
Art.6 Contd...
b. the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular

GDPR as to how are they defined
We will be proceeding with the rest in the upcoming session
.

Art. 7 GDPR: Conditions for consent
Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able
to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of
his or her personal data.
If the data subject’s consent is given in the context of a written
declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for
consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly
distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily
accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a
declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall
not be binding.
Art.7 Contd...
The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her
consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the
lawfulness of processing based on consent before its
withdrawal.^3 Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be
informed thereof.^4 It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give
consent.
When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account
shall be taken of whether, inter alia , the performance of a contract,
including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to
the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the
performance of that contract.
Art. 8 : Conditions applicable to child's
consent in relation to information
society services
1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of
information society services directly to a child, the processing of the
personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16
years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such
processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is
given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the
child. Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those
purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.
Art.8 Contd...
The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases
that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental
responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available
technology.
Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member
States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a
contract in relation to a child.

An important chapter consisting of Arts. 12 to 23 dealing mainly
with various rights of data subject.
CASE STUDIES
Google LLC v. CNIL-
British Airways Data
Breach
Facebook and Cambridge
Analytica
1.Google LLC v. CNIL
In this case, the French data protection authority, CNIL, fined
Google € 50 million for violating GDPR provisions related to
transparency and consent.
CNIL found that Google had not provided users with sufficient
information about how their data was being collected and used,
and had not obtained valid consent for targeted advertising.
This case highlighted the importance of GDPR's transparency and
consent requirements for companies that collect and process
personal data.
2. British Airways Data Breach
In 2018 , British Airways suffered a data breach that exposed
the personal data of over 400 , 000 customers.
The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) fined British
Airways £ 20 million for failing to take appropriate security
measures to protect personal data.
This case demonstrated the importance of GDPR's security
requirements for companies that handle personal data.
3. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica
In 2018 , it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had obtained
the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their
consent,and had used this data to influence political campaigns.
The UK ICO fined Facebook £ 500 , 000 for failing to protect users'
personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (which was
superseded by GDPR), and Facebook later agreed to pay a $ 5
billion settlement to the US Federal Trade Commission for violating
users' privacy.
This case illustrated the need for stronger privacy protections for
users of online platforms and the importance of GDPR's provisions
on consent, data portability, and data protection by design and
default.
Recap
We discussed three land mark cases in the realm of GDPR
together with brief descriptions of the facts and the outcome
This would help to give you all an understanding about how
crucial it is to meet and comply with GDPR requirements.
It also shows the quantum of punishment by way of fine that was
awarded for violating GDPR requirements.

Art. 24 Responsibility of the controller
1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of
processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity
for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller
shall implement appropriate technical and organisational
measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that
processing is performed in accordance with this
Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated
where necessary.
Art. 24 contd...
Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the
measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the
implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the
controller.
Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article
40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to inArticle
42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate
compliance with the obligations of the controller.
Art. 25: Data protection by design and
by default
1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation
and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as
the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of
natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at
the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the
time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are
designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data
minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary
safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of
this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.
Art.25 contd...
The controller shall implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal
data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing
are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data
collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage
and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by
default personal data are not made accessible without the individual’s
intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.
An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be
used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
Art. 26: Joint controllers
1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and
means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a
transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for
compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in
particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject
and their respective duties to provide the information referred to
in Articles 13 and 14 , by means of an arrangement between them
unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the
controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which
the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a
contact point for data subjects.
Art.26 contd...
The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the
respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the
data subjects.^2 The essence of the arrangement shall be made
available to the data subject.
Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in
paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under
this Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers.

We discussed Arts. 24 , 25 & 26.
Dealing with responsibility of controller; data protection by design
& default & Joint controllers
Art. 28: Processor
Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the
controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such
a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this
Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.
The processor shall not engage another processor without prior
specific or general written authorization of the controller. In the case
of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the
controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or
replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the
opportunity to object to such changes.
Art.28 contd...
3. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or
other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding
on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out
the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature

Art.30 contd...
The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the
controller’s or the processor’s representative, shall make the record
available to the supervisory authority on request.
The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to
an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons
unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not
occasional, or the processing includes special categories of data as
referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal
convictions and offences referred to inArticle 10.
How to comply with Article 30
Explain to stakeholders the benefits of having an up-to-date data
inventory
Gather the approximate number of business processes that need
to be mapped from stakeholders.
- Asset inventories and vendor lists can be leveraged to help get an idea of
the size and scope of the business mapping project.
Start with a pilot project using one business unit to test and
validate the methodology used to gather the information needed.
- Then use early deliverables from the pilot to secure better engagement
for the broader project.
Map your business processes.
Illustration
Let's say that A runs an online store that sells clothing. As part of
running A’s business, A collect’s and process’s personal data from A’s
customers, such as their name, address, email address, and payment
information.
Article 30 of the GDPR requires you to maintain a record of your
processing activities, including:
The categories of personal data you process (e.g., name, address,
email address, payment information)
The purposes of the processing (e.g., to fulfill orders, process
payments)
The legal basis for the processing (e.g., consent, contract)
Contd...
The recipients of the personal data (e.g., shipping companies, payment
processors)
The retention period for the personal data (e.g., how long you will keep
the data)
The security measures you have in place to protect the personal data
To comply with Article 30, A would need to create a comprehensive
record of your processing activities and keep it up to date. This would
involve documenting all the personal data A collects and processes, the
reasons for doing so, and the steps A took to protect that data.
This record would help A to demonstrate to regulators that A is taking
GDPR compliance seriously and would also be useful in the event of a
data breach or other security incident.
Recap
We discussed Art. 30 in detail regarding records of processing
activities
The illustration provides clarity in what is required to be done by a
processor to comply with Art. 30.
Art. 32: Security of processing
1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and
the nature, scope,context and purposes of processing as well as the risk
of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security
appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:
a. the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;

b. the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and
resilience of processing systemsand services;

c. the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a
timely manner in the event of a physical or technicalincident;

Art.32 contd...
d. a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the
effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the
security of the processing.
In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in
particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from
accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise
processed.
Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or
an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be
used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.
Art.32 contd...
4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any
natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the
processor who has access to personal data does not process
them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she
is required to do so by Union or Member State law.
Art. 33:Notification of a personal data
breach to the supervisory authority
1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without
undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after
having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the
supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55,
unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the
rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to
the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be
accompanied by reasons for the delay.
2. The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after
becoming aware of a personal data breach.
Art.33 contd...
The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:
a. describe the nature of the personal data breach including where
possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal
data records concerned;
b. communicate the name and contact details of the data protection
officer or other contact point where more information can be
obtained;
c. describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;
d. describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the
controller to address the personal data breach, including, where
appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
Art.33 contd...
Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the
information at the same time, the information may be provided in
phases without undue further delay.
The controller shall document any personal data breaches,
comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its
effects and the remedial action taken.^2 That documentation shall
enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this
Article.

Transfers subject to
appropriate safe guards
Case Study - 2 - Art. 49-
Derogations for specific
situations
CASE STUDY – Art. 46
One example of a case study involving Article 46 GDPR is the SchremsII case. In this case, an
Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems, filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission
(DPC) alleging that Facebook's transfer of personal data from the EU to the US was illegal under the
GDPR because the US did not provide an adequate level of data protection.
The case ultimately reached the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which ruled in July 2020 that the
EU-US Privacy Shield, a framework that allowed for the transfer of personal data between the EU
and the US, was invalid. The ECJ also found that the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), a
commonly used mechanism for transferring data to third countries, were valid but required
additional safeguards to ensure adequate protection of personal data.
The ECJ's decision in the SchremsII case highlighted the importance of complying with Article 46
GDPR when transferring personal data to third countries. Companies must assess the adequacy of
data protection in the destination country and implement appropriate safeguards, such as SCCs
with additional measures, to ensure the protection of personal data. Failure to comply with these
requirements can result in significant fines and reputational damage.
Conclusion
The Court stipulated stricter requirements for the transfer of
personal data based on standard contract clauses (SCCs). Data
controllers or processors that intend to transfer data based on
SCCs must ensure that the data subject is granted a level of
protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the EU Charter of
Fundamental Rights (CFR) – if necessary with additional measures
to compensate for lacunae in protection of third-country legal
systems. Failing that, operators must suspend the transfer of
personal data outside the EU.
Case Study - 2
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) issued
guidance on the use of personal data in the context of the pandemic.
The guidance highlighted that in certain emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
it may be necessary to transfer personal data to third countries that do not provide an adequate
level of data protection. For example, if a European hospital needs to transfer personal data of a
patient to a hospital in a third country where the patient is being treated, this may be necessary
to provide the best possible medical care for the patient.
However, in such cases, the EDPB emphasized that the transfer of personal data must be limited
to what is strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve the intended purpose. The data
controller must also assess the risks and take appropriate measures to mitigate those risks.
Furthermore, the transfer of personal data in emergency situations should only take place if there
are no other available options that would ensure an adequate level of data protection. The data
controller must also notify the relevant supervisory authority of the transfer and document the
transfer and the reasons for it.
Conclusion
This case study highlights the importance of complying with Article
49 GDPR when transferring personal data to third countries in
emergency situations. While there may be exceptions to the general
rule that personal data can only be transferred to third countries with
an adequate level of data protection, such transfers must be limited
to what is strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve the
intended purpose, and appropriate safeguards must be
implemented to protect the personal data.

to third countries or international organisations which were
concluded by Member States prior to 24 May 2016, and which
comply with Union law as applicable prior to that date, shall
remain in force until amended, replaced or revoked.
General Conclusion
1.Compliance : Many organizations that handle personal data are subject to the GDPR. As a cybersecurity
professional, understanding the GDPR and how it applies to your organization can help ensure that your
organization is in compliance with the regulation. This can help avoid potential fines and penalties, as
well as reputational damage that can result from non-compliance.
2.Data protection : The GDPR is focused on protecting the privacy and security of personal data. As a
cybersecurity professional, understanding the GDPR can help you implement appropriate security
measures to protect personal data and prevent data breaches.
3.Risk management : The GDPR requires organizations to conduct risk assessments and implement
appropriate safeguards to protect personal data. As a cybersecurity professional, understanding the
GDPR can help you identify potential risks and implement appropriate controls to mitigate those risks.
4.Incident response : The GDPR requires organizations to report data breaches to supervisory authorities
and affected data subjects within a certain timeframe. As a cybersecurity professional, understanding
the GDPR can help you develop and implement an effective incident response plan to detect, contain,
and respond to data breaches in a timely and effective manner.

Hence, understanding the GDPR as a cybersecurity professional can help you ensure compliance, protect personal
data, manage risks, and respond effectively to data breaches. It can also help you stay up-to-date with current data
protection laws and best practices, which is essential in today's rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape.
Recap
With this we come to an end of GDPR.
Hence the basics of what the GDPR is , its purpose, its compliance
requirements and its implementation etc have been covered. The
GDPR is the first of its kind of regulations for protection of personal
data.
It is thus a pioneering piece of legislation in the filed of data
protection.

Chapter 4
We will be taking up -
Art. 35- Data protection
impact assessment
Art. 36 - Notification of a
personal data breach to
the supervisory authority
Art. 35:Data protection impact
assessment
Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies,
and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of
the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and
freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the
processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the
envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal
data.^2 A single assessment may address a set of similar processing
operations that present similar high risks.
The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer,
where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact
assessment.
Art.35 contd...
A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall
in particular be required in the case of:
a. a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to
natural persons which is based on automated processing, including
profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects
concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the
natural person;
b. processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to
in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and
offences referred to in Article 10; or
c. a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.
Art.35 contd...
The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the
kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement
for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph
1.The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the
Board referred to inArticle 68.
The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of
the kind of processing operations for which no data protection
impact assessment is required.The supervisory authority shall
communicate those lists to the Board.
Art.35 contd...
6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5,
the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency
mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve
processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or
services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in
several Member States, or may substantially affect the free
movement of personal data within the Union.
7. The assessment shall contain at least:
a. systematic description of the envisaged processing operations
and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable,
the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;
Art.35 contd...
b. an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing
operations in relation to the purposes;

c. an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and

d. the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards,
security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of
personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation
taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data
subjects and other persons concerned.

Art.35 contd...
Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article
40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due
account in assessing the impact of the processing operations
performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the
purposes of a data protection impact assessment.
Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data
subjects or their representatives on the intended processing,
without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public
interests or the security of processing operations.
Art.35 contd...
10.Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal
basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the
controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation
or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact
assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact
assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs
1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to
carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.

11.Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if
processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact
assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by
processing operations.

Art. 36 :Prior consultation
The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing
where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates
that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures
taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.
Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended
processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in
particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated
the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks
of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the
controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its
powers referred to in Article 58.
Art.36 contd...
That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the
complexity of the intended processing.^3 The supervisory authority
shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of
any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for
consultation together with the reasons for the delay.^4 Those periods
may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained
information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation

3. When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph
1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with:
Art.36 contd...
a. where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint
controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for
processing within a group of undertakings;

b. the purposes and means of the intended processing;

c. the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and
freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation;

d. where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;

e. the data protection impact assessment provided for inArticle 35; and

f. any other information requested by the supervisory authority.

Art.36 contd...
Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the
preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by
a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a
legislative measure, which relates to processing.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require
controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation from, the
supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the
performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public
interest, including processing in relation to social protection and
public health.

CASE STUDIES
Art. 36 - Notification of a
personal data breach to
the supervisory authority
Will discuss two case
studies relating to Art. 36
Case Study 1
A large e-commerce company based in the EU suffered a data breach that compromised the personal
data of thousands of its customers. The company was notified of the breach by one of its employees
and promptly took steps to mitigate the damage by informing its customers, disabling affected
accounts, and resetting passwords.
However, as a result of the breach, the company realized that it had failed to implement adequate
security measures to protect its customers' personal data. It had also failed to conduct regular risk
assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in its systems.
In light of these findings, the company invoked Article 36 of the GDPR and conducted a Data
Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to determine the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the
breach, as well as the risks to the rights and freedoms of its customers.
The DPIA revealed that the breach had resulted in the unauthorized access, disclosure, and potentially
unlawful use of its customers' personal data, including their names, addresses, phone numbers, email
addresses, and credit card information. It also identified several risks to its customers' rights and
freedoms, such as identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.
Based on the findings of the DPIA, the company took further steps to mitigate the risks to its
customers' rights and freedoms. This included implementing additional security measures to protect
customer data, conducting regular risk assessments, and providing its customers with clear and
transparent information about how their data was being processed and protected.
Conclusion of case study 1
In this case, Article 36 of the GDPR was used by the company to
identify and address risks to the rights and freedoms of its
customers following a data breach.
The DPIA allowed the company to assess the impact of the
breach and take appropriate measures to mitigate the risks to its
customers' personal data.
Case Study - 2
A multinational financial institution suffered a major data breach that resulted in the theft of
confidential and sensitive customer data, including names, addresses, social security numbers,
credit card numbers, and financial transaction information. The breach was caused by a
